# Feature Specification: Build a containerized infrastructure using Docker and Docker Compose

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-containerized`  
**Created**: 2025-09-22  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a containerized infrastructure using Docker and Docker Compose. The system must include NGINX with TLS, WordPress with php-fpm, and MariaDB, each in its own container. The goal is to learn system administration through Docker by creating a reproducible environment that runs a secure WordPress site with isolated services. Volumes will persist data, domain name macauchy.42.fr will point to the setup, and containers will follow best practices for security and maintainability. Bonus features are included to extend functionality: - Redis cache for WordPress performance, - FTP server to access WordPress files, - A static website (non-PHP) for additional content, - Adminer to manage MariaDB visually, - An optional extra service chosen for utility and justification during defense."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
2. Extract key concepts: containerized services, security, reproducibility, persistent data, domain setup, bonus features.
3. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What is the expected scale (users/traffic)?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section.
5. Generate Functional Requirements (see below).
6. Identify Key Entities (see below).
7. Run Review Checklist.
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user (student or evaluator) can deploy the project and, with minimal configuration, access a secure WordPress site at macauchy.42.fr, with all services running in isolated containers. Data persists across restarts, and bonus features are available for enhanced functionality.

### Acceptance Scenarios
- User can run a single command to start all services in containers.
- NGINX serves WordPress over HTTPS (TLS) at macauchy.42.fr.
- WordPress is accessible and fully functional, using php-fpm and MariaDB.
- Data in MariaDB and WordPress persists after container restarts.
- No secrets or credentials are present in the repository.
- Redis cache is available and improves WordPress performance.
- FTP server allows access to WordPress files.
- Static website is accessible as a separate service.
- Adminer provides web-based MariaDB management.
- An extra service is present, justified in documentation.
- All containers follow security and maintainability best practices.
- The environment is reproducible by any contributor.

---

## Functional Requirements
- The system MUST use Docker and Docker Compose for orchestration.
- Each core service (NGINX, WordPress/php-fpm, MariaDB) MUST run in its own container.
- NGINX MUST terminate TLS and proxy to WordPress.
- Volumes MUST be used for persistent data (MariaDB, WordPress uploads, etc.).
- The domain macauchy.42.fr MUST resolve to the running setup.
- No secrets or credentials MAY be committed to the repository.
- All containers MUST use minimal, secure images and follow best practices.
- The system MUST be reproducible with a single command.
- Bonus: Redis MUST be available for WordPress caching.
- Bonus: FTP server MUST allow file access to WordPress files.
- Bonus: Static website MUST be served as a separate containerized service.
- Bonus: Adminer MUST provide web-based MariaDB management.
- Bonus: An extra service MUST be included, with justification.
- All services MUST be isolated and communicate only as required.
- Documentation MUST explain setup, usage, and security considerations.
